# Thank you for choosing Konsol.bat

For Program to work properly I recommend you to: 
 - Use Windows 10 OS or never (windows 7 - 8.1 works as well but there are graphical  bugs)
 - Have Consolas font set as your terminal font (or any other one properly displaying special characters that are part of program's code)

## That's all!
Have a nice morning/day/afternoon/evening/night!
